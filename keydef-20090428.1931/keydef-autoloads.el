Define the key sequence SEQ, written in kbd form, to run CMD.
CMD is automatically wrapped in an anonymous interactive function if it
is Emacs Lisp code rather than a command name. SEQ may also have the form
\(MODE SEQ) where the car is a mode name; for example

  (keydef (latex \"C-c %\") comment-region)

means to define the given key in latex-mode-map. And this will work even
if latex-mode is not loaded yet, provided that it is possible to deduce
the file that it will be loaded from, either from the autoload info or
by searching for a matching file name in the Emacs load path.

For best results, the \"mode name\" that you use here should yield the
proper foo-mode-map symbol when \"-mode-map\" is appended; although
this will normally match the mode name as given in the mode line,
Shell-script is one example I can think of where it doesn't---the map is
named sh-mode-map. The common cases that I know about, including
shell-script-mode and latex-mode, are handled as exceptions through the
variable mode-map-alist. But for other cases you will need to look up
the name of the mode-map that goes with the given mode.
